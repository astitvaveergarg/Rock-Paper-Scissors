# Rock Paper Scissors
 
The object of the rock-paper-scissor python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with a computer, anywhere, and anytime. This project is base on the rules that:

rock blunts scissors so rock wins
scissors cut the paper so scissors win
paper cover rock so paper wins


This project is build using Random Module and the basic concept of Python.

In this python project, players have to choose any one from rock, paper, and scissors.
